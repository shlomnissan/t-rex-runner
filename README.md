This repository contains a port of Chrome's Dinosaur Game written in modern C++. It uses modern CMake for build generation and Conan 2 as its package manager.

### Notes
- The original JavaScript source code for this game can be found [here](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:components/neterror/resources/offline.js).
- This port is accurate except for the missing Pterodactyl obstacle and night mode.

### Dependencies
All dependencies for this project are imported using Conan 2.
- `fmt/8.1.1` is used for string formatting.
- `rapidjson/1.1.0` is used for reading JSON configuration files.
- `sdl/2.26.5` is used for cross-platform system facilities.

This package also includes the `libs/stb_image.h` header for loading image files.

### Getting started
Make sure you have Conan 2 and CMake installed on your system.
<pre>
<b>$</b> git clone https://github.com/shlomnissan/trex-runner.git
<b>$</b> cd trex-runner
<b>$</b> conan install . --output-folder=build -b=missing -s=build_type=Debug
<b>$</b> cd build
<b>$</b> cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="conan_toolchain.cmake" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
<b>$</b> cmake --build .
</pre>

Following these commands should result in an executable called `trex-runner` in the build directory. If you encounter any issues with Conan, take a look at the [Build a Simple CMake Project using Conan](https://docs.conan.io/2/tutorial/consuming_packages/build_simple_cmake_project.html) tutorial, which will guide you through this process step-by-step.
